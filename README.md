## Description

The motivation behind this project was to challenge myself and advance my skills in web development. Specifically, I aimed to deepen my understanding of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML, while also mastering the Git Flow process. This project provided a structured opportunity to apply these technologies and methodologies in a practical setting.

I built this project not only to test my ability to implement key web development technologies but also to serve as a benchmark for my growth. My goal is to reflect on this project in five years and evaluate the progress I have made from the early stages of my development journey.

This project addresses the need for a personal reference tool by enabling me to review and revisit the notes I have compiled throughout my bootcamp program. It provides a structured and accessible way to reflect on and consolidate the knowledge gained during the course.

Through this project, I gained comprehensive experience in developing a webpage from inception to deployment. I learned how to construct the foundational structure using HTML, enhance its appearance with CSS, and implement advanced functionalities with JavaScript. Additionally, I acquired practical skills in deploying the webpage, making it accessible to a global audience.

The Prework Study Guide is designed to serve as a comprehensive reference for various web development topics covered during the bootcamp. Each section of the guide contains detailed notes on specific subjects such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Users can explore these sections to review and solidify their understanding of these technologies. By opening the DevTools console in the browser, users can observe JavaScript in action, which dynamically generates a list of the topics covered and selects one topic for focused study. This interactive feature helps streamline the learning process and ensures that users can efficiently navigate their study material.
